        <p class="zzzMsoNormal">
            <span lang="EN-IN" style="color:black">1. Some teach that enticement from within us comes from a demon. But the Bible says that we are tempted to sin by &#8220;<b><i><u>enticement</u></i></b><i> from the lusts in our own flesh</i>&#8221; (James 1:14).&nbsp; A truly born-again &nbsp;believer CANNOT &nbsp;have a demon residing within him. The Bible says, &#8220;What harmony has Christ with Belial&#8221; (2 Cor.6:15). The Holy Spirit dwells in a person&#8217;s <b><i>spirit</i></b> when he repents and accepts Christ as his Saviour. Demons also seek to live in a person&#8217;s spirit. But the Holy Spirit and a demon <b><i>cannot live together</i></b> in anyone&#8217;s spirit. Demons may dwell in someone who is not really born again but who CLAIMS to be born again, or in someone who was once born again but who has backslidden and lost his salvation. But never in a person who has Christ living in his spirit.</span><span lang="EN-IN"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

    <p class="zzzMsoNormal">
        <span lang="EN-IN" style="color:black">2. When we get angry, we cannot blame that on a demon. Anger is a lust in the flesh that we have to &#8220;put away&#8221; (Eph.4:31) and not something that can be cast out. I have seen people with demons changed immediately on deliverance. So if anger were a demon then the &#8220;delivered&#8221; person should immediately stop ever getting angry again. But such &#8220;delivered&#8221; people are still not free from&nbsp; anger &#8211; thereby proving that anger is <i>not</i> a demon. <span lang="EN-IN" style="color: black">Most people who get angry, usually <i>do not want to</i> get angry - that doesn&#39;t mean they are demon possessed.&nbsp; </span>Most people who get angry also usually cool off after a while. But they get angry again. So, anger has to be crucified (Gal.5:24).&nbsp; It cannot be cast out.</span><o:p><o:p></o:p></o:p></p>

    <p class="zzzMsoNormal">
        <span lang="EN-IN" style="color:black">3. Fear and doubts about God&#8217;s love and about one&#8217;s salvation are <b><i>not</i></b> evidences of demon-possession. They are the result of unbelief in the Word of God. The solution is to meditate on and believe in the Word of God &#8211; and not by casting out any demon.</span></p>
        <p class="zzzMsoNormal">
            &nbsp;</p>
        <p class="zzzMsoNormal">
            4. <span lang="EN-IN" style="color:black">Physical affliction does not imply that a person is possessed by a demon.&nbsp; Consider arthritis, for example. If arthritis were a demon then medical treatment would not be able to help such people. But medical treatment <b><u>does</u></b> help people with arthritis.&nbsp; So it is not a demon. However the Bible does say that if we don&#8217;t forgive others, we will be tormented (because Jesus said that in Matt.18:34). That could result in severe sicknesses&nbsp; or that the believer loses his salvation and AFTER THAT gets possessed by a demon.&nbsp; Or also consider outward physical habits like nail-biting.&nbsp; Nail-biting is a sign of nervousness. It is not because of demon-possession. </span><span lang="EN-IN"><o:p></o:p></span>
        </p>
    <p class="zzzMsoNormal">
        <span lang="EN-IN" style="color:black">&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-IN"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="zzzMsoNormal">
        <span lang="EN-IN" style="color:black">5. Some may attribute addictions to being possessed by a demon. I disagree. People may be able to stop drinking alcohol when they want to, for example (even non-Christians). But most people can&#8217;t overcome anger or sexually lustful thoughts just by deciding to.</span></p>
    <p class="zzzMsoNormal">
        <span lang="EN-IN" style="color:black">&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-IN"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="zzzMsoNormal">
        <span lang="EN-IN" style="color:black">6. Another important point to understand is that demons do not have to enter a person in order to deceive him. People are deceived by listening to the teachings inspired by demons - from outside of them. (2 Cor 11:13-15)</span></p>
    <p class="zzzMsoNormal">

    <p class="zzzMsoNormal">
        <span lang="EN-IN" style="color:black">7. Jesus took only one second to cast out a &#8220;Legion&#8221; of demons. (A legion = 5000) (Mark 5:9-15). One does not have to cast out demons one by one or over a period of time. </span><span lang="EN-IN"><o:p></o:p></span>

    <p class="zzzMsoNormal">
        <span lang="EN-IN" style="color:black">8. You may sometims feel sleepy when planning to read the Bible. This is not because of demon-possession, but because of a lack of interest in the Bible.&nbsp; It cannot be blamed on demons.</span><span lang="EN-IN"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

    <p class="zzzMsoNormal">
        <span lang="EN-IN" style="color:black">9. Demons may try to affect our emotions and attitudes, they can only do that to a Christian from the outside. But it is a person&#8217;s WILL that they primarily seek to influence to turn him away from God.</span><span lang="EN-IN"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

        <span lang="EN-IN" style="color:black">11. What he says in 14:00 onwards as coming from demons, actually comes from our own lusts.</span><span lang="EN-IN"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

        <p class="zzzMsoNormal">
            The Bible teaches clearly that we have to take responsibility for our own sin.&nbsp; We cannot attribute it to anybody else, like our to our heritage or our ancestors, for example.&nbsp; <span lang="EN-IN"><span style="color:black"> Some teach that we must confess the sins that our ancestors committed. But it is not possible for anyone to confess the sins that someone else committed, on his behalf. It is wrong to say that we are punished for sins committed by our ancestors. Each person is punished <b><i>for his own sins</i></b> as the Lord has made clear in Jeremiah 31:29, 30<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>and also in the whole of Ezekiel Chapter 18. We are not punished for the sins committed by our parents or any of our ancestors.</span></span></p>
        <p class="zzzMsoNormal">
            &nbsp;</p>
        <p class="zzzMsoNormal">
            <span lang="EN-IN"><span style="color:black">Another group we cannot attribute our sins to is demons.&nbsp; Many sins may be falsely called &#8220;demon-possession&#8221; (gossip, cursing, lying, lust, etc), but the Bible nowhere calls these demon possession, it calls them sins!&nbsp; It is important to have an understanding of this, so please consider the following points. </span></span></p>
    <p class="zzzMsoNormal">
        &nbsp;</p>
        <p class="zzzMsoNormal">
            <span lang="EN-IN" style="color:black">We must crucify <b><strong>our own </strong></b>flesh with its lusts (Gal.5:24). If the sins people fight are due to demon-possession, then such people should be pitied and not punished. No-one is punished for having a demon. The demon has to be cast out. But those who commit the sins and do not take the blame themselves and repent of them <b><u>will finally be punished</u></b> by God for those sins. That is what God&#39;s Word teaches - and that proves that these sins were not demons. </span><span lang="EN-IN"><o:p></o:p></span>
    </p>
    <p class="zzzMsoNormal">
        &nbsp;</p>
    <p class="zzzMsoNormal">
        <span lang="EN-IN" style="color:black">Many Christians may be in such awe of &#8220;great and famous&#8221; Bible-teachers that they do not question what they say on this matter of demons. This is because most Christians do not know God&#8217;s Word and also because they have never dealt with demons themselves.</span><span lang="EN-IN"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="zzzMsoNormal">
        &nbsp;</p>
    <p class="zzzMsoNormal">
        <span lang="EN-IN" style="color:black">We must be careful when listening to <b><i><u>any</u></i></b> preacher, to ensure that we are not deceived. We must be like the Bereans (Acts 17:10) who compared <b><u>even what the apostle Paul taught</u></b> with the Word of God before accepting it. That is why there is no epistle written to the Bereans. They never went astray into any false teaching, because they checked every person&#8217;s preaching with God&#8217;s Word.&nbsp; That is a good example for all of us to follow.</span><span lang="EN-IN"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

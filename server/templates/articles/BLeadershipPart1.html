            Ephesians 4:11&nbsp;<em>And He&nbsp;gave&nbsp;some&nbsp;as&nbsp;apostles, and some&nbsp;as&nbsp;prophets, and some&nbsp;as&nbsp;evangelists, and some&nbsp;as&nbsp;pastors and&nbsp;teachers,&nbsp;12&nbsp;for the equipping of the&nbsp;saints for the work of service, to the building up of&nbsp;the body of Christ;&nbsp;13&nbsp;until we all attain to&nbsp;the unity of the faith, and of the&nbsp;knowledge of the Son of God, to a&nbsp;mature man, to the measure of the stature&nbsp;which belongs to the&nbsp;fullness of Christ.</em></p>

Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial">This is one of the clearest chapters in the whole Bible on how we can grow spiritually.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This passage is very clearly saying: if we want to know the Son of God and have a deep relationship with Him, and to be mature, and to grow up spiritually to be like Jesus, then I see here that I cannot do it without the church to help build me up with their gifts - including the leadership within the church, to help oversee my life, and help guide me to the Lord.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I cannot sit at home and listen to sermons and read my Bible by myself and expect to grow in the Lord much.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps in some cases, the Lord will call someone to be alone for some time (such as Paul when he was in prison, or people who are waiting for some time while sincerely seeking the Lord for fellowship), but in general, I see that this being built up by others and along with 
            others is God&#8217;s will for each of us.<br /></span></p>

            of the month.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Spiritually, we can come and go to any church as we&#8217;d like, run in any direction we want.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We don&#8217;t have to listen to anybody that tries to stop us, and we can say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t need anybody to help find the truth and guide me, I can find it on my own &#8211; just me and my Bible.&#8221;<br /></span></p>

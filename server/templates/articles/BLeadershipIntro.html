Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial">For many years, I read the Bible on my own, and listened to many sermons, and sought the Lord on my own.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I continually found myself frustrated because I never really had confidence in the truth or understanding that I was hearing and learning.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And what I believed often changed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Generally what I read in the Bible and what I heard preached agreed (the church is good, evangelism is good, Bible study is good, lusting is bad, loving money is bad - for example), but I was really confused with many things and how they all fit together - such as; what is the emphasis I should have?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>How do I practically live all these things out?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And am I on the right track?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

            <span style="mso-ascii-font-family:Arial;mso-hansi-font-family:
Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial">For example, I know that sin is bad.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But how much should I focus on fighting sin?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Will I automatically just become more Christ-like over time?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Is it just something Jesus has forgiven me for so I don&#8217;t have to think about it or worry about it and can focus on other things - like saving the lost from Hell?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What about social outreach?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Outreach and helping the poor is a great thing &#8211; the Bible talks about it, but what place does that take in my life?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Should I devote myself to helping poor people, and spend 75% of my time, money, and thoughts on it, or is it secondary to something else?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

            breaking like disobeying traffic signals or walking outside of the crosswalks.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was very burdensome!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

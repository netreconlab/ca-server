            <span style="">&#8220;But realize this, that in the last days difficult times will come...&nbsp;Evil men and impostors will proceed from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. You, however, continue in the things you have learned and become convinced of,&nbsp;<b>knowing from whom you have learned them</b>,&#8221;&nbsp; 2 Timothy 3:1, 13-14 NASB<o:p></o:p></span></p>

            <span style="">We see here that one of the things that will make the last days especially difficult is that deception will be rampant. Jesus Himself warned us strongly against this in Mark 13 and Matthew 24, indicating that there would be deceivers who come in His Name, proclaiming Jesus to be the Christ, but who we should guard ourselves against. And it struck me that, of all the conceivable protections that Paul might exhort Timothy to avail himself of,&nbsp;specifically mentions the weight of his personal example</i></b>, encouraging Timothy to draw upon his experience of living and ministering with Paul. &nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

            <span style="">What a blessing it is to &#8220;know from whom we have learned&#8221; Christ. I consider it one of the greatest privileges of my life that I have come to know Brother Zac Poonen, his son Sandeep Poonen, and Bobby McDonald. And I have personally discovered the wisdom of the Holy Spirit&#8217;s encouragement here: to seek protection from deception by carefully observing the lives of the various teachers that come across my path (through sermons on the Internet, books, blogs, etc), and to then select godly men from among them to whom I can joyfully submit. I have been saved from countless heartaches, needless condemnation, unconscious sinful attitudes, and many other snares through the protection of submission to godly leaders.&nbsp;  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none">

            <span style="">It seems to me that submission is one of the most neglected virtues in America today. In fact, most would argue that it’s not a virtue so much as a curse word! But&nbsp;submission was the secret of Jesus’s life and power (John 4:34,&nbsp;6:38,&nbsp;8:28,&nbsp;12:49,&nbsp;14:10), and it is the secret of ours as well (Luke 7:8-9). It is especially worth noting that submission was the Father’s appointed path of preparation for Jesus’ earthly ministry. In Luke 2:51, it says Jesus “continued in subjection” to&nbsp;Joseph and Mary, who were not only&nbsp;<i><u>imperfect</u></i>, but who also, even by His youth, didn’t have as much understanding, but who also, even by His youth, didn&#8217;t have as much understanding as He did (Luke 2:50); humbly accepting this God-appointed pathway of submission is how &#8220;Jesus kept increasing in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men&#8221; (Luke 2:52)!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none">
            <span style="">Many will say that we only need to submit to the Lord Jesus, without regard for any man, but I see that as a clear violation of Scripture (Hebrews 13:17 indicates plural), and of Jesus&#8217; Own example for us. I want to take the same path of preparation that Jesus did. Plus, I want the positive benefit of having my soul be watched over!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

            <span style="">I realize that, in our hyper-rationalistic age, there are many who&#8217;d prefer to gather teachers unto themselves, weigh the collective &#8220;arguments&#8221; as they see them, and then settle on their own interpretation of the Scriptures. But the Bible itself&nbsp;warns against such thinking&nbsp;(2 Timothy 4:3,&nbsp;2 Peter 1:20). God has given&nbsp;an anointed teaching ministry in favor of our own evaluation of the myriad of interpretations, we do so to the detriment of our growth in Christ (Ephesians 4:13-16).&nbsp;So the question, to me, is not&nbsp;<i>whether&nbsp;</i>to submit to a particular teacher, but rather,&nbsp;<i>to whom&nbsp;</i>should I submit?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

This wasn&#8217;t some faraway observation; he says, &#8220;you know what kind of men we proved to be in your presence.&#8221; What a testimony! He&#8217;s saying, in essence, &#8220;examine what you&#8217;ve seen of our lives &#8212; lives that have been lived in close proximity to you, over time &#8212; and see whether they bear witness to the power of the gospel we proclaim.&#8221; What an opportunity to joyfully submit to someone who can say that in truth!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

I have personally experienced the protection and power that comes in the pathway of submission. That is not to say, by the way, that I continue to diminish or negate the precious principle of submission itself — and no matter what may happen with these brothers, I’ll seek to joyfully submit to whomever can lead me into greater devotion to Jesus for as long as I live. And as the Holy 
            Spirit continues to bear witness to His work in these brothers’ lives, bearing the fruit of the gospel they proclaim, I continue to submit&nbsp;<i>joyfully&nbsp;</i>(“God loves a cheerful giver,” 2 Corinthians 9:7).&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
